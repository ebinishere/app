# The functions here are expected to be called periodically. 
# How this periodicity is achieved is immaterial ti test application.
# It can from from a for loop or from an rtos
# The periodicity between the functions are important
# eg task_1x should be called twice as task_2x and 4 times compared to task_4x
# where x is the base task rate.
